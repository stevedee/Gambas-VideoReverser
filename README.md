# Gambas-VideoReverser
A Gambas program to reverse video clips

This program uses ffmpeg, mplayer & sox in a series of commands to allow a video clip to be reversed (i.e. it will run backwards).
The speed of this reversed video chip can also be changed (e.g. made faster or slower). This will work with or without an audio track(s).
